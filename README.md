Homework #5, Daily Planner

The goal of this project was to create a web application that acts as a daily calendar. When the user types their tasks into the forms on each day and saves them, the data is saved to local storage and remains upon refreshing the page. The current date and day of the week are displayed at the top of the page, and the time slots change color according to whether they are in the past, present, or future. 

I somehow missed the folder that included the HTML and CSS and ended up hard-coding and styling the whole thing from start to finish, which was in itself a good exercise. Something I couldn't figure out was how to make the save and grab functions DRY. They are all written out the long way. I'll revisit this after submitting to see if I can't do it!

I had to have some help with the colorChange function, which I got from my tutor. I understand why it works and also had a very proud moment where I figured (out on my own!) that I needed to assign military time to the hours behind the scenes in order for the color change to work correctly. 

All in all a fun project that taught me new things: how to use Moment.js, helped me get better at using local storage, and gave me good practice creating and working with functions.
